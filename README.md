### About:
- A running game where users have to move between 3 lanes to dodge from obstacles and collect as much coins as possible.
- User has 3 lives. Each life is deducted if player hits the obstacles.
- If all lives are lost, player loses.
- If player gets to the end of the game without dying, player wins.


#### Features:
- Score count is on the top right corner.
- Life count is top left corner. User has 3 lives to start with.
- Journey bar lets the user know how far they've ran, and also which Level they're currently at or reaching. The speed increases every level (by increasing the frame rate), and makes the game more challenging and exciting to play.
- Each lane will have coins and obstacles that are positioned randomly between 3 lanes.
